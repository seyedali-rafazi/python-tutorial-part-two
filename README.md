# What I've Learned from Python

This GitHub repository documents my learning journey in Python, focusing on key concepts and topics. Below, I'll outline what I've learned about various Python features.

## Arrays

In Python, arrays are collections of items that can hold multiple data types. Lists are commonly used as arrays, and they provide versatile ways to store and manipulate data.

## Debugging

Debugging is a crucial skill in programming. Python offers various debugging tools and techniques to help identify and resolve issues in your code.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are data structures that store key-value pairs. They are highly useful for quick data retrieval and storage of structured information.

## Exceptions

Python uses exceptions to handle errors gracefully. Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage unexpected situations in your code.

## Generators

Generators are a way to create iterators in Python. They allow you to iterate over large datasets efficiently without loading everything into memory.

## Lists

Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. They can hold an ordered collection of items and are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.

## Sets

Sets are collections of unique elements. They are useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or checking for membership efficiently.

## Tuple

A tuple is an immutable collection of ordered elements. Tuples are commonly used when you need to store a fixed set of values that should not be changed.

## Unpacking Operators

Python provides unpacking operators like `*` and `**` that allow you to extract elements from iterable objects or pass multiple arguments to functions using iterable unpacking.

These are some of the key concepts and topics I've learned about in Python. As my learning journey continues, I'll keep updating this repository with more insights and practical applications of these concepts.
